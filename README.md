**Project Description**

A set of webscrapers that output data pulled from various newspaoers and inserts them into a locally hosted database

## Notes 

if you're setting up a db to store the files that will be input, be mindful of the datatype/chartype. The body text column functions much better as a UTF8mb4 rather than utf8
